== Some Tips on how to use docToolchain in an Enterprise Environment

Some things are different when you use them at a larger scale.
That's why I would like to share my experience with docToolchain in an Enterprise Environment.

=== Corporate Identity

When you change the design of your microsite, you give your employees the chance to better identify with the documentation.
The documentation will feel more "official".
Take a look at xref:040_microsite/130_theming.adoc[] to see how you change the look and feel.

=== CI/CD Pipelines

To automatically build your documentation on change and deploy it to GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages, please take a look at this demo project: https://github.com/docToolchain/ci-cd-demo[ci-cd-demo].
It contains a https://github.com/docToolchain/ci-cd-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml[GitHub workflow] and a https://github.com/docToolchain/ci-cd-demo/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml[.gitlab-ci.yml] which you can use as a starter for your own setup.

NOTE: Both systems, GitHub and GitLab, only provide _one_ static page for each repository.
So, if you build the docs in a feature branch, the main docs will be updated.
To avoid this, you should restrict the pipeline to your main or default branch.
Since all links of the generated docs are relative, you can use the generated artifacts from a PR-Pipeline to get a preview.

=== Dependencies

The 2.2.1 docker image of docToolchain should be self-contained.
Dependency resolution shouldn't be a problem with this image.
You should run your build pipeline directly on this image.
`dtcw` will notice it is running within the image and use the dependencies.

When you need to use another version or create a local build, it might be that the sources for needed dependencies are unavailable (https://jfrog.com/blog/jcenter-sunset/).

To be prepared for such a case, you can specify your own corporate repository proxies.

Create a file `init.gradle` with content like the following:

[source, gradle]
----

settingsEvaluated { settings ->
    settings.pluginManagement {
        println "removing plugin management repositories: t" + repositories.getNames()

        repositories.clear()

        // add your own artifactory as repository
        repositories {
            maven {
                url "<your maven proxy repository for maven central>"
                credentials {
                    username = "<your maven proxy username>"
                    password = "<your maven proxy password>"
                }
            }
        }
        println "new plugin management repositories: " + repositories.getNames()
    }
    settings.dependencyResolutionManagement {
        println "removing dependency resolution management repositories: " + repositories.getNames()

        repositories.clear()

        // add your own artifactory as repository
        repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.PREFER_SETTINGS)
        repositories {
            maven {
                url "<your maven proxy repository for maven central>"
                credentials {
                    username = "<your maven proxy username>"
                    password = "<your maven proxy password>"
                }
            }
        }
        println "new dependency resolution management repositories: " + repositories.getNames()
    }
}

// needed because currently gradle does not allow to override the buildscript repositories of the script plugins
gradle.projectsLoaded {
	rootProject.allprojects {
			project.setProperty("mavenRepository", "<your maven proxy repository for maven central>")
			project.setProperty("mavenUsername", "<your maven proxy username>")
			project.setProperty("mavenPassword", "<your maven proxy password>")

			project.setProperty("depsMavenRepository", "<your maven proxy repository for maven central>")
			project.setProperty("depsMavenUsername", "<your maven proxy username>")
			project.setProperty("depsMavenPassword", "<your maven proxy password>")
		}
    }
}

println ">>> repository locations initialized via init.gradle"

----

and reference the file when you execute a `dtcw` command like this:

    ./dtcw -I $(pwd)/init.gradle <task>

See https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/init_scripts.html for more details on this approach.
